# Name: 
Physics - Kinematic Equation Solver

## Examples:
```processing
 vf = kinematic(5, 2, 8);
```

## Description:
The program calculates the final velocity based on the given acceleration, initial velocity, and distance.

## Syntax:
```processing
float kinematic(float vo, float a, float d){
}
```
##Parameters:
  Float vo is used to set initial velocity
  Float a is used to set acceleration
  Float d is used to set distance.

##Returns:
The program returns the final velocity, or the float vf. It is calculated using the equation vf^2 = vo^2 + 2ad.


##Other notes:
N/A
